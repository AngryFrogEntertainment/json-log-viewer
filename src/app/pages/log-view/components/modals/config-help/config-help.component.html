			This configuration defines how your log entries are interpreted. Basically the parser just parses every line in
			your log file into an js object. Now you need to tell it where it can find the rigt properties to display what you
			want to see.
		</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 20px"><b>Profile:</b> You can create multiple profiles for different formats of your
					logfiles. "+" Adds a new one.</li>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 20px"><b>Timestamp:</b> The name of the property that is representing the timestamp.
					It will be displayed in the list.</li>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 20px"><b>Level:</b> The name of the property that is representing the used log level.
					It will be displayed in the list.</li>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 20px"><b>Message:</b> The log message of your object. Yup, also displayed in the list.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h6>Optional properties</h6>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 20px"><b>Meta informations:</b> Sometimes you need more than just a message to find a
					bug. So you log objects like errors or current states of your model etc. Here you can tell the log viewer the
					name of that property. It will be displayed in a modal when you click oon the entry in the list. <i>If it is
						not defined the complete log entry will be displayed.</i></li>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 20px"><b>Context:</b> We like to log the class name where the log was written as
					context of the specific message. If you do too, then this is your chance to tell the log viewer where. It will
					be displayed in the list and the modal. <i>If it is not defined you will not see anything.</i></li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h6>Formatting</h6>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 20px"><b>Date format:</b> Since we all donÂ´t live in the same country and we have
					different ways to display a date, you can tell the log viewer how you like it. <b>It has nothing to do with
						the date format inside of your log file. It is just for display purposes. As long as your file contains a
						parsable date string, it will do. If not, you got a problem.</b></li>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 20px"><b>Page size:</b> You can define here how many log entries you want to see on
					one page. It has a slight impact on performance. The more there is to be rendered at once, got it?</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<p><b>Note: Except for the meta informations all properties are expected to be a string. If not you will get a
					"Invalid key" replacer.</b></p>
